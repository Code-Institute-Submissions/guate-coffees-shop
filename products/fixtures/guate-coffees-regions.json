Every once in a while, Fuego—one of Guatemala’s three active volcanoes—adds a fresh dusting of mineral-rich ash to Antigua’s soil.  Volcanic pumice in the soil retains moisture, which helps offset Antigua’s low rainfall. In Antigua, shade is especially dense to protect the coffee plants from the region’s occasional frost.",

Most Rainforest Cobán is cultivated on the area’s distinctive rolling hills, under the tropical influences of the Atlantic Basin, in limestone and clay soils. Cobán has two seasons: rainy and rainier.  Cobán’s celebrated chipichipi frequently engulfs the region in a fine mist that falls from the dense cloud cover.",

    "description": "In this region, coffee has been cultivated since the 1950s. Today, virtually every farm on the mountain has become a coffee-producing unit and what was once one of the poorest and most isolated areas of Guatemala is vibrant and growing.  Rainy and cloudy, Oriente is located on a former volcanic range. Its soil is made of metamorphic rock: balanced in minerals and quite different from soils in regions which have seen volcanic activity since coffee was first planted.",

    "description": "The warmest of the eight coffee-growing regions, San Marcos also has the highest rainfall pattern, reaching up to 200 inches (5,000 mm).  The seasonal rains come sooner than in other regions, producing the earliest flowering.  As in all of Guatemala’s remote regions, most of Volcanic San Marcos is cultivated on farms with their own processing mills. Because of the unpredictability of rainfall during the harvest season, much of the coffee is pre-dried in the sun and finished in a Guardiola dryer.",

Pacaya, the most active of Guatemala’s three erupting volcanoes, supplies the region with a light deposit of ash every so often, giving the soil an important mineral boost.
