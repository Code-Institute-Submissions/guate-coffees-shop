        "description": "Nestled between three massive volcanoes at an elevation of 5,000 feet, the Antigua Valley of Guatemala produces arguably the world's finest coffee. Only here does the heirloom variety of Arabica bean known as Borbón develop such a sublimely sweet coffee fruit, with the dry climate stressing trees just enough to give the beans their tantalizingly complex flavors. Among coffee appellations, Antigua is perhaps the best of the best. One estate in this renowned region stands out above all others, both for its quality and care: Finca San Sebastián. Early sun, upper slopes, an abundance of shaded Borbón—everything about this farm is perfect for producing coffee of consistently superlative quality. Environmental stewardship and community support is integral to Finca San Sebastián’s operations. In addition to implementing practices that care for the land and workers, the farm houses and funds a local school that educates more than 100 children each year; we contribute to this work with every pound we purchase.",
